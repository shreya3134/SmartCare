# SmartCare

Deployment using streamlit 
Developed a hybrid machine learning model that recommends personalized medicines and exercises based on patient data. Implemented multi-label classification (Random Forest with MultiOutputClassifier) to suggest multiple treatments and a regression model to predict patient recovery days. Integrated text features (e.g., disease history, BP level) using TF-IDF and scaled numerical vitals for model training. Achieved detailed performance evaluation using accuracy, classification reports, and RMSE.
